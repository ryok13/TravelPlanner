### 📌 Travel Planner – Node.js + Express + MongoDB

COMP2068 JavaScript Frameworks – Assignment 02

This project is a Travel Planner Web Application that allows users to create, manage, and view their trips.
It includes full user authentication, CRUD operations for trips, protected routes, and a fully integrated front-end template.

---

### 🚀 Features

### 🔐 User Authentication (Passport.js + passport-local-mongoose)

- User registration

- Login / Logout

- Automatic password hashing

- Session-based authentication

- Flash error messages

- Access restrictions: only logged–in users can view or manage trips

---

### 🧳 Trip Management

Authenticated users can:

- View their own trips

- Create a new trip

- Edit existing trips

- Delete trips

- View trip details pages

---

### 🎨 UI / Templates

- Built with Handlebars (hbs)

- Fully integrated Colorlib “Trips” template

- Navbar changes automatically based on login state

- Responsive design using Bootstrap

- Shared layout for header/footer/navigation

---

### 🛡️ Authentication Flow

- Registration

- User.register() hashes the password and saves the user

- User is automatically logged in

- Redirects to /trips

- Login

- passport.authenticate('local') verifies username + password

- Success → redirect to /trips

- Failure → redirect to /login with an error message

- Protected Routes

Middleware prevents unauthorized access:

    if (req.isAuthenticated()) next();
    else res.redirect("/login");

---

### ✨ Additional Notes

- Each trip is associated with the logged-in user

- Users cannot modify or delete others’ trips

- Handlebars helper eq is used to highlight active navbar items

- method-override enables PUT and DELETE requests

--- 

### 📚 What I Learned

- This assignment helped reinforce:

- Express routing patterns

- Designing Mongoose models

- Implementing authentication using Passport.js

- Managing sessions and flash messages

- Building server-rendered UI using Handlebars

- Structuring a full-stack MVC-style Node.js application

---

### 💡 Possible Future Enhancements

- Photo upload for trips

- Sorting / filtering by date or budget

- Public API version (REST endpoints)

- Map integration using Google Maps API
